\title{Extracts the predicted NSEC values from a multivariate brmsfit.}
\usage{
nsec_multi(
  object,
  sig_val = 0.01,
  resolution = 50,
  x_range = NA,
  xform = identity,
  prob_vals = c(0.5, 0.025, 0.975),
  posterior = FALSE,
  x_var,
  trials_var = NA,
  multi_var = NA,

  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An object of class \code{\link{bayesnecfit}} or
\code{\link{bayesmanecfit}} returned by \code{\link{bnec}}.}

\item{sig_val}{Probability value to use as the lower quantile to test
significance of the predicted posterior values.
against the lowest observed concentration (assumed to be the control), to
estimate NEC as an interpolated NOEC value from smooth ECx curves.}

\item{resolution}{The number of unique x values over which to find NSEC -
large values will make the NSEC estimate more precise.}

\item{x_range}{A range of x values over which to consider extracting NSEC.}

\item{xform}{A function to apply to the returned estimated concentration
values.}

\item{prob_vals}{A vector indicating the probability values over which to
return the estimated NSEC value. Defaults to 0.5 (median) and 0.025 and
0.975 (95 percent credible intervals).}

\item{posterior}{A \code{\link[base]{logical}} value indicating if the full
posterior sample of calculated NSEC values should be returned instead of
just the median and credible intervals as defined by prob_vals.}

\item{x_var}{A character indicating the name of the predictor (x) data in object}

\item{trials_var}{NA if no trials, or a character vector indicating the name or
prefix of any trials column(s).}

\item{multi_var}{NA if univariate, or a character vector indicating the name or
prefix of the multivariate column(s).}

\item{type}{The type of nsec to be returned. See details.}

\item{criterion}{The criterion to use when type ='lowest'.}

\item{...}{Further arguments to pass to class specific methods.}
}
\value{
A vector or list containing the estimated NSEC value(s).
}
\description{
Extracts the predicted NSEC values from a multivariate brmsfit.
}
\details{
nsecID extracts nsec values from response curves of unknown
direction or shape. Both increasing and/or decreasing nsec's can be returned.
The returned output depends on the selected type, which can be one of 'both',
'lower', 'increasing', 'decreasing'.
